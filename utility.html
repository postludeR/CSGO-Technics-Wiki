    <h1>UTILITY</h1>
    <h2>Utility is the second most critical part of CSGO after shooting, and this page provides novice players with an overview of utilities and how they work, as well as their tactics. However, the most important thing is to remember the throwing aiming points of these utilities, which I have provided as a link to the video as a supplement. Players of all levels can learn about the aiming points of utilities that they have not mastered. In addition, all players can generously share their newly developed method on the Contact page.</h2>

        <h1>HE Grenade</h1>
        <p>Inflict a certain amount of damage to the enemy behind the cover, cause a slowdown effect on the enemy at a specific location, or perform a pre-judgment throw at the location where the enemy often appears.</p>
        <blockquote>“The high explosive fragmentation grenade administers high damage through a wide area, making it ideal for clearing out hostile rooms.”
            <p></p>―Official description</blockquote>
        
        <h2>Damage to enemies behind cover</h2>
        <p>After locking or predicting the enemy's position, use the rebound mechanism to damage the enemy behind the cover</p>
        <h2>Slow down</h2>
        <p>Any enemy that takes damage from the grenade explosion will be slowed, causing allied wonder timing.</p>
        <h2>High IQ usage</h2>

        <h2>Push back enemies</h2>
        <p>When fighting for control of the map, use incendiary bombs with pop-flash to regain control of an important location while dealing damage and even critical kills. De_inferno's banana control is a classic example.</p>

        <p>Temporarily blind and block hearing effects for varying durations based on the player's position relative to the angle of the flashbang explosion. This chart below shows the actual effects:</p>

        <blockquote>“The non-lethal flashbang grenade temporarily blinds anybody within its concussive blast, making it perfect for flushing out closed-in areas. Its loud explosion also temporarily masks the sound of footsteps.”
            <p></p>―Official description</blockquote>
        <h2>Pop-flash</h2>
        <p>Pop-flash is a CS:GO technique based on flashbang explosion timing and map understanding, mastering it allows opponents to be blinded without time to react. Without this technique, flashbangs have little effect on high-level players, who are very skilled at turning their backs to the direction of the flashbang explosion.</p>
        <p>To use a standard pop-flash, typically you need to get close to a doorway, wall, or the side of a set of stairs, raise your field of view to around a 75-degree angle, and right-click to throw. Other pop-flash need specific exercises to remeber the aiming points.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, when pop-flashing for teammates, you need to estimate and calculate the distance, angle and explosion time of the pop-flash. When assisting your teammates, it's a wise idea to use your flash first, but it takes time to do so.</p>
        <p>The video below shows a nice pop-flash:</p>

        </video>

        <h2>Push back the sniper</h2>
        <p>When attacking, if it is clear that the aiming position of the enemy sniper is where we must appear, we can use flash bombs to force the sniper back, so as to expand our formation without reducing the number of personnel.</p>

        <h1>Smoke Grenade</h1>
        <p>Smoke is the tactical tool that can be used to provide smoke screen cover, confuse the enemy, or hinder enemy visibility and discouraging them from attacking(Last for 15s).</p>
        <blockquote>“The smoke grenade creates a medium-area smoke screen. It can effectively hide your team from snipers, or even just create a useful distraction.”
            <p></p>―Official description</blockquote>
        <h2>Limit the shooting locations</h2>
        <p>When attacking as a T side or defending as a CT side, smoke bombs can be used to limit the possible positions of the enemy, especially some advantageous shooting positions, to avoid being completely destroyed by cross fire when attacking the boom site.</p>
        <p>As a defender, you need to retreat behind the smoke bomb to avoid attrition to reorganize the attack, or use the enemy's smoke bomb's mistakes, such as <b><i>one-way smoke</i></b>, to cooperate with your teammates' flashbang and molotov for defense.</p>
        <p>The video below shows a typical based on smoke grenades:</p>
        <video controls height="500" width="800">
            <source src="video/5smoke.mp4">
        </video>
        <h2>Extinguish the flame</h2>
        <p>In Global Offensive, the smoke grenade will release the smoke instantly when it makes contact with flames from the Molotov and Incendiary Grenade, and will extinguish the fire. Firebombs will fail to emit fire if they were thrown into a smoke.</p>
        
        <h2>One-way Smoke</h2>
        <p>‘One-way’ smoke is a certain kind of smoke that allows you to see or kill a player without the risk of being noticed - the enemy simply cannot see you. This mechanic is one of the most useful and difficult to execute, but it also helps to achieve maximum advantage with low risk for the performer.</p>

    <div class="flash">
        <h1>Molotov/Incendiary Grenade</h1>
        <p>Generates a flame that lasts for 7 seconds within a certain range, causing continuous damage to enemies within the flame. The damage increases every second, and the flame range spreads in a small area over time. Incendiary(600$) for CT and Molotov(400$) for T are just have the diffirence in price.</p>
        <blockquote>“The Molotov is a powerful and unpredictable area denial weapon that bursts into flames when thrown on the ground, injuring any player in its radius.”
            <p></p>―Official description</blockquote>
        <blockquote>“When thrown, the incendiary grenade releases a high-temperature chemical reaction capable of burning anyone within its wide blast radius.”
            <p></p>―Official description</blockquote>
        <h2>Limit the shooting locations</h2>
        <p>When the T side is attacking or the CT side is defending, smoke bombs can be used to limit the possible positions of the enemy, and the explosion position is bound to be limited, so as to avoid the enemy's use of cross-fire during the attack. The usage is the same as the smoke bomb, but the duration is shorter.</p>
        <h2>Prevent RUSH and Block the key road</h2>
        <p>Enemies tend to use SMGs and pistols for quick attack tactics when the economy is low, incendiary bombs can destroy quick attacks very well, providing valuable time to seize shooting positions.</p>
